# H0N3Y_SC4N

H0N3Y_SC4N was a project for one of my Cybersecurity classes. 
Its purpose was to simulate open and closed ports to protect systems from port scan attacks. 
Additionally, it creates a log file with all the requests made to the host system.

The script features a minimal interface allowing users to choose the range of ports that it will modify packets for.

SETUP:
To get started, you'll need to change this line: [ conf.iface = "WiFi" ] Replace "WiFi" with your network interface.

DON'T FORGET to read the dependencies file to ensure you meet all the requirements of the script and avoid any potential errors.
